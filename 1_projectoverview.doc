Project
Design a website for local massage therapist Rachel Yamagiwa (no web presence)

Overview
Rachel Yamagiwa is a massage therapist with a strong, loyal community of clients but no web presence, as she generally does not feel comfortable with tech. She occasionally has to ask websites that host business information to take her name and false information down after they put it up without her permission, as clients will think they can contact her through those sites to make appointments but she never receives their messages. She has been in business for many years with no website. I have received her permission to create a website with correct business information in order to circumvent these problems, and host accurate information for clients to reference.
